# Design Document
### Design decisions
We followed the diagonal format, where the top few lines are longer and the bottom few lines are shorter. PIC

We also clumped together all the tasks, since they are associated together, with the completed tasks on top. ANOTHER PIC
### Alternative designs
We decided to use green for the "Done" and "Delete completed" buttons,
since green is associated with growing, natural, and successful. PIC HERE
### User testing
### Challenges we faced
We had a bit of trouble in the beginning with getting used to pulling before doing any work and pushing after completing some tasks.
